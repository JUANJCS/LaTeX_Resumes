\Section{Executive Profile} 
\textbf{Technical Program Manager: Global Cloud Governance \& Transformation} \\ 
10 years experience scaling global digital services, bridging 5 years of distributed cloud governance with 5 years of hardware leadership across the connectivity chain. 
\begin{itemize} 
    \item \textbf{Cloud Scaling:} Decomposed legacy monoliths into event-driven architectures (Kafka, AWS) to deliver 99.9\% availability for a 4M+ vehicle fleet; expanded operations from a single team to a five-team Agile Release Train. 
    \item \textbf{FinOps \& Governance:} Reduced cloud unit-costs by 30\% through architectural optimization while directing multi-team delivery and enforcing GDPR and global regulatory compliance (China RTM, eCall). 
    \item \textbf{Systems Integration:} Managed the hardware-to-cloud bridge using technical experience in Electronic Control Unit integration, RTOS firmware development (C/C++), and high-availability API design. 
\end{itemize}

\Section{Work Experience} 

\textbf{CARIAD SE} $|$ \textbf{Technical Program Manager (Senior Product Owner)} \hfill \textit{Wolfsburg, Germany $|$ Nov 2020 -- Aug 2025} 
\begin{itemize} 
\item Directed the Service Activation Cluster, managing the end-to-end roadmap and ensuring 99.9\% operational uptime for an ART of five DevOps teams delivering digital services for a 4M+ vehicle fleet. 
\item Led the transition to an event-driven architecture (Kafka, SNS/SQS), eliminating monolithic dependency bottlenecks to enable asynchronous scaling and platform-wide notification services.
\item Deployed the technical infrastructure for Functions on Demand (FoD) and custom B2B fleet services for partners like Avis and Sixt, unlocking the commercial launch of pay-per-use digital features for the Volkswagen Group. 
\item Enforced a multi-year FinOps program achieving a 30\% unit-cost reduction on AWS through architectural redesign of database access patterns and optimized logging/reconciliation frequencies. 
\item Governed global regulatory constraints, including China’s RTM, EU eCall standards, and architectural separation of physical databases to meet North American sovereignty demands. 
\end{itemize}

\textbf{SEAT S.A.} $|$ \textbf{Technical Project Lead (Connectivity Systems)} \hfill \textit{Barcelona, Spain $|$ Mar 2019 -- Nov 2020} 
\begin{itemize} 
\item Synchronized hardware and software release cycles for connectivity modules (OCU2 to OCU4), ensuring alignment with series production (SOP) milestones for three major vehicle lines. 
\item Steered the technical interface with Tier-1 suppliers (LG), prioritizing delivery of critical hardware revisions and development samples for firmware validation. 
\item Validated 100\% compliance for safety-critical EU eCall regulatory standards, supervising high-stakes crash and homologation test preparations to ensure hardware and data survivability. 
\item Resolved integration blockers at the Technical Development Centre (CTS) by engineering diagnostic protocols and CAN-message mocking scripts to train cross-functional validation teams. 
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Akkodis} $|$ \textbf{Systems Integration Engineer} \hfill \textit{Barcelona, Spain $|$ Oct 2015 -- Mar 2019} 
\begin{itemize} 
    \item Architected application logic and firmware for NFC-based IoT wearables and parking systems, managing strict power optimization and real-time constraints for resource-limited battery-powered devices. 
    \item Developed custom Linux drivers for low-level connectivity modules and engineered hardware emulators (Python/Qt) to accelerate protocol validation workflows. 
    \item Consulted for SEAT S.A. (6 months), leading software release validation and hardware-in-the-loop (HiL) testing for series-production connectivity units. 
\end{itemize} 

\Section{Languages \& Certifications}
