Dear Hiring Team,

I was pleased to find this opening at Siemens, as it aligns closely with the work I have been doing in recent
years and with the direction in which I want to grow. After leading several large cloud programmes for
Volkswagen Group, I am looking for a role where building and evolving cloud platforms is central again—
where there is room for technical depth, long-term product thinking and meaningful impact. Siemens’
current cloud transformation fits that perfectly.

In my recent roles at CARIAD, I guided multi-team initiatives focused on backend consolidation, platform
coherence and cloud service reliability across 10–12 Agile/DevOps teams. My work centred on creating
structure in complex environments: aligning engineering with product priorities, shaping service evolution
and ensuring predictable delivery during architectural change. These are the strengths I rely on consistently
and the perspective I would bring to Siemens.

What attracts me especially in this role is the chance to contribute to a platform that supports multiple
domains, integrates diverse systems and needs to operate at scale. This is the type of environment where
I work best—connecting strategy with execution, bringing clarity to cross-functional teams and steering
platform maturity over time.

I am planning to relocate to Zürich and would welcome the opportunity to contribute to Siemens as you
continue strengthening your cloud foundations and digital product ecosystem.
