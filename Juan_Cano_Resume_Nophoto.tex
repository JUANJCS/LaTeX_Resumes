% SUMMARY 
% ============================================================ 
\Section{Executive Profile} 
\textbf{Technical Program Manager: Systems \& Automotive Lifecycle Strategy} \\ 
10 years of experience in automotive industrialization and digital transformation, bridging deep hardware engineering with global cloud operations. Specialized in the end-to-end lifecycle of connected systems, from embedded R\&D to large-scale series production (SOP).
\begin{itemize} 
    \item \textbf{Global Lifecycle Management:} Orchestrated the transition of mission-critical components from development into global operations, managing distributed teams across Germany, India, and China to optimize delivery costs.
    \item \textbf{Strategic Industrialization:} Synchronized hardware/software milestones with automotive series production (SOP), ensuring 100\% compliance with safety-critical standards and Tier-1 supplier manufacturing schedules.
    \item \textbf{Technical Orchestration:} Architected high-availability systems (99.9\% uptime) for 4M+ vehicles using a deep technical foundation in MSc Telecommunications, C/C++ firmware, and AWS/Kafka cloud infrastructure.
\end{itemize}

\Section{Work Experience} 

\textbf{CARIAD SE} $|$ \textbf{Technical Program Manager (Senior Product Owner)} \hfill \textit{Wolfsburg, Germany $|$ Nov 2020 -- Aug 2025} 
\begin{itemize} 
\item Directed the Strategic Roadmap for the Service Activation Cluster, overseeing the delivery of digital services for a 4M+ vehicle fleet and managing the lifecycle transition from R\&D to global operations. 
\item Engineered a global offshoring strategy to reduce operational overhead; managed five DevOps teams, including the successful transfer of maintenance and support modules to offshore hubs in India and China.
\item Architected the shift to event-driven architectures (Kafka, SNS/SQS), eliminating system bottlenecks to enable asynchronous scaling across international markets (incl. China RTM and North American sovereignty).
\item Reduced cloud unit-costs by 30\% through architectural redesign and performance-based resource allocation, balancing aggressive cost-saving targets with 99.9\% availability requirements. 
\item Enforced global regulatory and safety compliance, ensuring technical infrastructure alignment with EU eCall and international data privacy standards.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{SEAT S.A.} $|$ \textbf{Technical Project Lead (Connectivity Systems)} \hfill \textit{Barcelona, Spain $|$ Mar 2019 -- Nov 2020} 
\begin{itemize} 
\item Synchronized hardware/software release cycles for connectivity modules (OCU2 to OCU4), ensuring 100\% manufacturing readiness for \textbf{Series Production (SOP)} milestones across three vehicle lines. 
\item Managed the technical supply chain interface with Tier-1 suppliers (LG), directing the delivery of hardware revisions and development samples for multi-site firmware validation. 
\item Validated compliance for safety-critical EU eCall standards, leading high-stakes crash tests and homologation preparations to ensure data survivability and hardware integrity. 
\item Resolved cross-functional integration blockers at the Technical Development Centre (CTS) by engineering diagnostic protocols and CAN-message mocking scripts for validation teams. 
\end{itemize} 

\vspace{8pt} 
\textbf{Akkodis} $|$ \textbf{Systems Integration Engineer} \hfill \textit{Barcelona, Spain $|$ Oct 2015 -- Mar 2019} 
\begin{itemize} 
    \item Developed application logic and firmware for NFC-based IoT systems, managing power optimization and real-time constraints for resource-limited battery devices. 
    \item Engineered custom Linux drivers and hardware emulators (Python/Qt) to accelerate cross-site protocol validation and reduce hardware-in-the-loop (HiL) testing cycles. 
    \item Consulted for SEAT S.A., leading release validation and HiL testing for series-production connectivity units. 
\end{itemize} 

\Section{Languages \& Certifications}
