% SUMMARY
% ============================================================
\Section{Summary}
Technical Lead with 10 years in automotive connectivity and a recent focus on scaling global cloud platforms to 4M+ vehicles. I specialize in migrating legacy Java monoliths to event-driven architectures—not just for technical evolution, but to deliver the aggressive unit-cost efficiency required for sustainable, large-scale platform operations.

\Section{Work Experience}

\textit{CARIAD SE (Volkswagen Group)} \hfill Wolfsburg, Germany \\
\textit{Technical Program Manager (Senior Product Owner)} \hfill Nov 2020 -- Aug 2025

\begin{itemize}
\item Directed the Service Activation Cluster, managing the end-to-end roadmap and ensuring 99.9\% operational uptime for an Agile Release Train (ART) of five DevOps teams delivering digital product activation for a 4M+ vehicle fleet.
\item Decomposed a legacy Java monolith into a five-team microservice architecture, scaling the organization from a single team while transitioning the platform from synchronous communication to asynchronous SNS/SQS and Kafka event streaming.
\item Orchestrated the technical delivery of Functions on Demand (FoD) and custom B2B fleet infrastructure for partners like Avis and Sixt, enabling new digital revenue streams for the Volkswagen Group.
\item Enforced a multi-year FinOps program achieving a 30\% unit-cost reduction on AWS through an architectural redesign that restricted database access patterns and optimized logging/reconciliation frequencies.
\item Governed global regulatory and geopolitical constraints, including China’s RTM requirements, EU eCall standards, and the architectural separation of physical databases for VW Canada to meet North American sovereignty demands.
\end{itemize}

\textit{SEAT S.A. (Volkswagen Group)} \hfill Barcelona, Spain \\
\textit{Technical Project Lead (Connectivity Systems)} \hfill Mar 2019 -- Nov 2020

\begin{itemize}
\item Synchronized hardware and software release cycles for multiple generations of vehicle connectivity modules (OCU2 to OCU4), ensuring alignment with series production (SOP) milestones for three major vehicle lines.
\item Steered the technical interface with Tier-1 suppliers (LG), maintaining the operational feedback loop to prioritize delivery of critical hardware revisions and development samples for firmware validation.
\item Validated 100\% compliance for safety-critical EU eCall regulatory standards, personally supervising high-stakes crash-test preparations in collaboration with the chassis department to ensure data survivability.
\item Resolved integration blockers at the Technical Development Centre (CTS) by engineering technical workarounds—including CAN-message mocking scripts and specialized power-cycle protocols—and training cross-functional teams on these diagnostic procedures.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{8pt}
\textit{AKKA Technologies (now Akkodis)} \hfill Barcelona, Spain \\
\textit{Systems Integration Engineer} \hfill Oct 2015 -- Mar 2019

\begin{itemize}
\item Developed custom Linux peripheral drivers and high-concurrency web interfaces for IoT parking systems, engineering Python/Qt-based hardware emulators to accelerate validation of CCTalk and NFC protocols.
\item Architected the full application logic for an NFC wearable prototype using a NXP-based RTOS, managing strict real-time constraints and power-optimization requirements within a high-velocity startup environment.
\item Consulted as an external Integration Engineer for SEAT S.A., leading the software release validation and hardware-in-the-loop (HiL) testing for series-production connectivity modules.
\end{itemize}
